# Hi... I'm Pramila

I am a Business Analyst with a technical background. I have experience in mobile application development, and as an Assistant Product Manager in a TMS company. I am passionate about understanding business needs, analyzing data, and translating requirements into practical solutions that support informed decision-making. This GitHub space features a mix of my academic and personal projects, focusing on business analysis, process improvement, and technology. Outside of work, I enjoy reading and traveling. If you’re interested in my projects or potential collaboration, feel free to connect.
